# Bootstrap Build Tools Starter

This starter repo may be for you if you want to:

- Eliminate duplication of redefining values to override Bootstrap’s defaults
- Reduce overall file size by leaving out parts of Bootstrap not needed for the project
- Remove the hassle of manually looking up and applying prefixes for things like flexbox
- Accomplish the above with minimal project bloat in terms of additional directories and other clutter

Used along with the post listed next, it is also beneficial if you are new to build tools.
